    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <h3>Junior Web Developer | Software Engineering Student</h3>
    <p>Husband, father and son that is constantly looking to learn and cultivate new skills. I'm an aspiring software engineer and entrepreneur that is looking to build and create from the ground up without relying too heavily on others to do the technical workload. I was in the U.S. Navy from 2006-2011 as an aviation electronics technician. I completed two full deployments and all the qualifying sea trials aboard the U.S.S. Abrahama Lincoln (CVN-72) and U.S.S. Harry S. Truman(CVN-75) and was briefly in the financial services industry. I'm not afraid to try something different and start from scratch as I care more about my development, mission and purpose more than a title or paycheck.</p>
